## Hi there! 👋

My name is Niklas, a 20 y/o from Stockholm, Sweden 📍

I'm a **passionate** and **driven** self-taught **Software Engineer** who is obsessed with **scalable applications** that provides a great **UX/UI** for the users, but also a great codebase for developers to work and scale with 🛠️

I'm currently working full-time at **[@MoliStreaming](https://github.com/molistreaming)**, a mobile live streaming startup 🚀

In my spare time, I write code on my personal projects and try to expand my knowledge in the backend world, with the goal of soon becoming a full-fledged Software Engineer 🧙🏼‍♂️

Other than coding, I also invest some of my time into the stock market 🤠
