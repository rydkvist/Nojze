## Hi there! 👋

I'm Niklas, a self-taught Software Engineer from Stockholm, Sweden 📍

As a passionate and driven individual, I'm focused on building scalable applications with great UX/UI 🎨 for users and maintainable codebases for developers. I love being a part of the entire software development process, from design to deployment 🛠️

In my spare time, I continue to expand my knowledge and work on personal projects, with the ultimate goal of becoming a full-fledged Software Engineer 🧙🏼‍♂️ 

When I'm not knacking code, you can find me keeping an eye on the stock market, exploring new destinations, or making connections with interesting individuals 🌍
